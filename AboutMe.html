    <h3><ul class= "Paragraph">
      <li>One aspect of my life includes playing Lacrosse, I love the sport and practice frequently.</li><br>

      <li>Another important part of my life includes design and 3D printing, what started as a project tumbled into a full-blown hobby.</li><br>

      <li>One other factor in my life includes aviation, My Dad flies frequently and is trying to teach me as well, starting with glider training.</li><br>

      <li>One last topic in my life includes outdoor sports including camping, climbing, kayaking, and others. I am a Boy Scout and so I have just grown to really enjoy outdoor sports and activities. Fun fact, I am also CPR certified.</li>
